# Digital Mirror - AI-Powered Personal Background Check

## Overview

Digital Mirror is a full-stack web application that uses AI to help individuals audit their own digital footprint. The app gathers public data about users from across the internet and compiles it into a private report. The focus is on providing users insight into their social media presence, public records, news mentions, sentiment analysis, and potential privacy risks â€“ all through an intuitive dashboard.

By enabling people to "background check" themselves, the tool helps identify what others (like employers or colleagues) might find online. It is designed with privacy, transparency, and compliance in mind, ensuring users only access information about themselves in an ethical manner.
